Yes – the reason your template preview links are returning a **404 Page Not Found** is due to a **routing mismatch** between the path you're trying to open (`/:businessSlug/website-:templateNumber`) and what `TemplatePreviewPage` expects.

---

### ✅ You’re Rendering:

In your `<App />` routing:

```tsx
<Route path="/:businessSlug/website-:templateNumber" component={SimpleGolfApp} />
```

This route only ever renders `SimpleGolfApp` regardless of category. But your `TemplatePreviewPage` with category-based logic (e.g., `golfclub`, `tradesman`, etc.) is never being used.

---

### 🔍 Root Cause:

* You have built `TemplatePreviewPage`, but it’s not **wired into the router**.
* You're expecting template previews to show different layouts based on the business category (like `golfclub` → `WorkingTemplate`, `tradesman` → hero image, etc.), but you're always routing to `SimpleGolfApp`, which is hardcoded for golf.

---

### 🛠️ Recommended Fix:

Update your router like so:

```tsx
import TemplatePreviewPage from "./pages/template-preview"; // <-- Add this import

<Switch>
  <Route path="/:businessSlug/website-:templateNumber" component={TemplatePreviewPage} /> // <-- Change here
  <Route path="/:businessSlug/services" component={Services} />
  <Route path="/:businessSlug" component={BusinessLanding} />
  <Route path="/" component={Home} />
  <Route component={NotFound} />
</Switch>
```

---

### ✅ Outcome:

This will:

* Route preview links like `/cumnockgolfclub/website-2` to `TemplatePreviewPage`
* Let `TemplatePreviewPage`:

  * Fetch the business
  * Determine the category
  * Render `WorkingTemplate` (for golf) or fallback UI for others
* Eliminate the 404 you're seeing on tradesmen templates (because currently, there’s no matching dynamic template logic for that category)

---

### 🧠 Optional Cleanup:

If `SimpleGolfApp` is now obsolete (as `WorkingTemplate` handles the golf rendering), you could remove `SimpleGolfApp` entirely or keep it only for legacy fallback.

Let me know if you'd like me to restructure the routing file or stub out a `TemplateRenderer` component that switches by category.
