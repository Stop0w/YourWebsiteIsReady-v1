📦 Project Brief: Frontend Infrastructure & Experience for Website-as-a-Service
🔧 Project Name
It’s Done
"We’ve already built it for you."
Primary domain: itsdone.com.au

🎯 Project Purpose
To create a scalable, category-based frontend platform that delivers pre-built personalized website previews to businesses that currently lack a professional web presence. Starting with golf clubs and tradesmen, the platform will showcase bespoke templated pages with upsell paths (hosting, updates, domain transfer).

🧱 Foundational Frontend Architecture
🌐 Domain URL Strategy
All pages will live under itsdone.com.au, structured as:

css
Copy
Edit
itsdone.com.au/[business-slug]                      → Personal landing page
itsdone.com.au/[business-slug]/website-[1–4]        → Templated website demos
itsdone.com.au/[business-slug]/services             → Summary of paid service offerings
Example:

bash
Copy
Edit
itsdone.com.au/cumnockgolfclub
itsdone.com.au/cumnockgolfclub/website-1
itsdone.com.au/cumnockgolfclub/services
🧭 Information Architecture (IA)
🔹 Global Pages
/ — Main homepage (optional for now)

/about (optional)

/categories (index of current categories)

🔹 Category-Level Template Sets
Each category will have 4 templates to choose from:

bash
Copy
Edit
/_templates/golfclub/website-1
/templates/tradesman/website-2
...
These will be reused and dynamically populated per business instance.

🏗️ Page Types
Page	Purpose	Notes
Landing Page /[business-slug]	Personalized sales page (pitch + preview)	Includes CTA to view templates or contact
Website Template /[business-slug]/website-[n]	Fully built preview (static, no backend)	Populated from dummy data for now
Service Overview /[business-slug]/services	Explains hosting, updates, custom domain	Will be reused with dynamic business name
Future: Global homepage /	(Optional) Marketing site for platform	Optional if you're going 100% outbound

🎨 Design System Guidelines
Element	Spec
Style	Simple, professional, adaptable per vertical
Color	Brand-neutral + a swappable accent per category
Layout	Modular, grid-based layouts
Template Variability	Swappable hero, about, gallery, contact
CTA	“Claim This Website” → placeholder form or link

🧰 Templating Requirements (Per Category)
Each category will have 4 frontend templates with:

Section	Required
Hero	Business name, tagline, banner image
About Section	Basic copy & intro
Photo Gallery	Optional (grabbed via Google/FB later)
Contact Info	Static for now
CTA	Claim / Learn more
Footer	Placeholder social links, copyright

🔌 Backend (High-Level Placeholder Plan)
While not required now, here’s the eventual backend architecture:

Component	Role
CMS or Flat JSON store	Store business content per slug (optional)
Templating engine (EJS / Flask / JSX)	Dynamically render templates
Make.com / Google Sheets API	Feed business data into the frontend
Domain mapping (optional)	Allow custom domain per business as a paid upgrade

🗂️ Categories: MVP Scope
✅ 1. Golf Clubs
Templates tailored to scenic photos, club info, booking CTA, course overview

Focus on minimal copy, large visuals, and clean nav

✅ 2. Tradesmen
Templates suited to electricians, plumbers, etc.

Emphasize services, testimonials, service area, contact form

🛣️ Growth Path: Adding More Categories
Once golf and trades are in place:

Duplicate the system for a new vertical (e.g. “cafés” or “personal trainers”)

Swap assets + tone in templates

Use same routing and structure

Easy to scale with minimal rework

✍️ Immediate Next Steps (Frontend Phase)
✅ Confirm global IA & routing structure

✅ Set up folder system and boilerplate templates

✅ Design and build 4 templates for:

Golf clubs

Tradesmen

✅ Build business landing page shell

✅ Create services page with a universal copy template

🔄 Populate with dummy JSON data for now
